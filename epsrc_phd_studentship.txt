Fully-funded PhD scholarship in "Natural Language Processing to Support Healthcare Decision Modelling" at the University of Sheffield. 

(Note that only UK/EU students are eligible for this scholarship and that any such students who have not been resident in the UK for the three years prior to their start date will be eligible for a Fees award only.)

About the project: 
Health policymakers make decisions about the adoption of treatments and services based on consideration of research evidence. The factors underpinning health decisions are complex and the volume and types of evidence of potential relevance are wide-ranging. Healthcare decision modellers and systematic reviewers are increasingly making use of methods from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing to identify and analyse the evidence they need. 

The project will apply techniques from Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval to develop tools that support healthcare decision analysts and systematic reviewers by helping them to identify and explore the information they require. The project aims to develop tools that help analysts identify relevant documents and minimise the number of non-relevant documents that have to be examined. It is expected that approaches such as topic models, visualisation and Information Extraction will be applied. 

The position will be based in Sheffield University's Computer Science Department and jointly supervised by Dr. Mark Stevenson (Computer Science), Professor Jim Chilcott (School of Health and Related Research) and Dr. Suzy Paisley (School of Health and Related Research).
